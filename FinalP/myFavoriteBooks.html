                    begins to tell the king tales of adventure, love, riches and wonder - tales of mystical lands
                    peopled with princes and hunchbacks, the Angel of Death and magical spirits, tales of the voyages of
                    Sindbad, of Ali Baba's outwitting a band of forty thieves and of jinnis trapped in rings and in
                    lamps. The sequence of stories will last 1,001 nights . . .</p>
